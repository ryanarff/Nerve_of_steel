# Nerve of Steel
### an MGTC28 Python script for playing Nerve of Steel
This Nerve of Steel is a party game where players sit in a circle.  When the game begins:

1. The program displays "Players stand"

2. The program sleeps for a random time between 5 to 25 seconds.  While the program is sleeping, players can sit down.  Keep track of the last person to sit down.

3. When sleep is over, the program displays "Time Up.  Last to sit down wins."  Players still standing are eliminated, and the winner is the last person to sit down.

timer.py uses the **time library** to help keep track of time and the **pillow library** to facilitate the image display.
